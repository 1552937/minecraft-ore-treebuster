Made by my friend. Licensed as open source but you'd better give credit to the author. 
This is a datapack for minecraft java that makes it so when you break one block it breaks all the other ores of the same type or logs of the same type that are connected to it. 
Feel free to make modifications and stuff and let me know. May even be added to this repo. 
If you do decide to make modifications to it remeber to read the liscense agreement.
